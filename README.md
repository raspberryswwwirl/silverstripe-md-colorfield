# SilverStripe supported module skeleton

A useful skeleton to more easily create a [Silverstripe Module](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/extending/modules/) that conform to the
[Module Standard](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/extending/modules/#module-standard).

This readme contains descriptions of the parts of this module base you should customise to meet you own module needs.
For example, the module name in the H1 above should be you own module name, and the description text you are reading now
is where you should provide a good short explanation of what your module does.

Where possible we have included default text that can be included as is into your module and indicated in 
other places where you need to customise it

Below is a template of the sections of your readme.md you should ideally include to met the Module Standard 
and help others make use of your modules.
